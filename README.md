I'm a data engineer with over a decade of experience working with data across various industries, including Telcos and Financial Services in South Africa and EMEA. 

:trident: Like a digital Neptune I have navigated the tumultous seas of small and big data, from the stormy shores of SAS, through the vast ocean of on-premise Hadoop and on to the cloud-kissed heights of AWS. I've shaped raw data into pearls of wisdom for decision-makers. 

Evidently, I can also use Chat-GPT.

âš¡ I am proficient in Python, PySpark, Terraform and SQL. 

I have spent hours coaxing enterprise Hadoop into submission, wrangling with data, partitioning and re-partitioning, and copying data from A to B, then B to C, then from C back to A. 

Sometimes they pay me for that.

ðŸ’¬ When I'm not knee-deep in data artitecture or processing petabytes of data, you can find me pondering life's great questions. Like whether Kerberos would produce a better error message if I sacrificied a few lambs (unfortunately none of his three heads posses the gift and curse of speech). 

I possess excellent technical skills, with the ability to pick up new technologies quickly.

ðŸ”­ Currently I head up Data Engineering at [cloudandthings.io](cloudandthings.io) , and oversee various data engineering projects. I've also developed a tool that I'm quite proud of to sync petabytes of data in near-realtime.
